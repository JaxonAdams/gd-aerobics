 # Description
 In this project, I have converted a physical punch pass system into a virtual system. Rather than looking through a binder containing people's passes, you can simply search them by name. You can punch, renew, and remove passes with the click of a button. Adding passes, and adding notes to passes, is done through a simple form. In order to interact with a punch pass, you must be logged in to a staff member account. This system was developed for Gotta Dance Performing Arts Studio, located in Eagle Mountain, UT.
